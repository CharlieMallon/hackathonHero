## Project Overview
Welcome to Rhythm Heroes!
This game is based on the retro Dance Dance Revolution arcade game. The goal of this game is to test your rhythm, your musical timing and your reflexes.


## How to play
First, select A song! Each song has a different difficulty level so choose wisely!
Once the game starts, you will see directional arrows sliding down your screen at different speeds and intervals according to the rhythm of the song. The goal is to tap the correct arrow when it reaches the target at the bottom of the screen. If your timing is good, your score will increase.

On keyboards, use the arrow keys ←↑→↓ and on your mobile device, simply tap the correct target at the bottom of the screen.
Good luck!

## Wireframes:

Some styling changes were made to the carousel and we decided against the split screen desktop deisplay for the game board, but the overall design for each page is consistent with the wireframes here.

# Testing

## Responsive Design
[Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Pesticide Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesticide-for-chrome-with/neonnmencpneifkhlmhmfhfiklgjmloi) was regularly used during development to test responsiveness on different  screen sizes.
To make the website responsive [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) and CSS was used.
Responsiveness for different screen sizes can be seen in the features section above.

## Validator Testing

## Deployment

 * We have used Gitpod an IDE to write the  game code.

 * Team worked on each task by making a fork of the original copy of the repo.

 * Team created a branch name and add individual work to the project repo using ```git add command```.

 * A pull request is created and added to the project logs.
   
 * The project lead reviewed and approved the pull request and merged to the project repository.
